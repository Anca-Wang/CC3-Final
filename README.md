## **Inspiration**

This project was inspired by a random thought I had while visiting the Tate museum. I noticed that the stories depicted on the walls were all about men, and I wondered if I could present a history story from a female perspective. That's when the idea of reconstructing matriarchal history with the help of AI and machine learning came to mind.

## **V1 Generation: Midjourney Generation**

Since there was limited available data on matriarchal history, I decided to generate images using AI. I used Midjourney for image generation, focusing on creating a sense of harmony and security associated with matriarchy. 

However, I realized that the generated images still resembled a patriarchal society rather than a true matriarchal one.

In matriarchal societies, women are embraced as strong, confident, powerful, courageous, and joyful individuals. In stark contrast to patriarchal societies, where women are often portrayed as weak, oppressed, dependent, and discontented, the feminine qualities in a matriarchal society celebrate strength and assertiveness without fear or hesitation. These women embody a resolute spirit, challenging the notion that beauty must be rescued, and instead, they revel in their inherent power.

## Feministsâ€™ **Feedback**

To address this issue, I sought feedback from the online community, particularly from feminist perspectives. According to their feedback, the current image resembled more of a serene realm of subservient wives rather than a true matriarchal society. Their insights underscored the urgency to liberate ourselves from the confines of patriarchal aesthetics and envision a world where women embody strength, empowerment, and wield significant positions of authority.

## **AI Bias Challenge**

With the intention of refining my project using the aforementioned feedback, I embarked on another round of image generation using Midjourney. However, this endeavor presented a new set of challenges intertwined with AI bias. 

Regrettably, the AI models employed in the process exhibited a pronounced inclination towards patriarchal norms, resulting in the generation of images rooted in preexisting datasets riddled with gender and racial biases.

For instance, when prompted with the phrase "a young girl," the AI invariably conjured up an image of a fair-skinned Western girl, donning skirts and boasting long hair, adhering to conventional stereotypes.

To precisely manifest my desired vision of a strong and confident girl adorned with trousers and sporting a short haircut, I must meticulously expand and tailor my prompt. By providing explicit details encompassing the specific attributes I seek, I can enhance the chances of generating an image that accurately portrays the empowered and self-assured girl I envision.

Overcoming this bias was difficult, as even specific prompts often resulted in images that perpetuated traditional gender roles and objectified women.


## ****V2 Generation: Style Transfer****

### 1. Style Transfer Model

To overcome AI bias limitations, I adopted style transfer techniques instead of direct image generation. For this purpose, I chose to utilize VGG19, a transfer learning model that can be found at this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shivanshuman/vgg19-transfer-learning

### 2. Content Image

To create the desired visuals, I carefully selected content images from a reality TV show called "Siren: Survive the Island." These images showcased professional women competing on an uninhabited island, demonstrating their strength, resilience, and intelligence, thereby breaking away from patriarchal narratives.


### 3. Style Image

Additionally, I used Midjourney to generate style images with the prompt of a matriarchal civilization. With the vivid colors and mosaic-like textures, , the image showcases women adorned in regal headdresses, symbolizing her authority and grace. The composition embodies a striking chiaroscuro technique, drawing inspiration from Etruscan art and the wall paintings of Pompeii.


## **Evaluation and Results**

By incorporating style transfer, I successfully conveyed the power, dignity, and empowerment associated with matriarchal societies. The resulting images depicted women as strong, confident, and independent, challenging the prevailing patriarchal norms in our society, also got highly evaluated by the feminism group.



## **Third-Party Resources**

For image generation, I utilized Midjourney and employed style transfer techniques to achieve the desired visual effects. The feedback and insights received from the feminist community played a crucial role in shaping the project's direction.

## **Conclusion**

Despite encountering challenges related to AI bias and the limitations of existing datasets, I remain steadfast in my commitment to pushing boundaries and envisioning alternative histories. Through the recontextualization of matriarchal societies, we can empower ourselves to shape a future that aligns with our vision of equality and justice.
